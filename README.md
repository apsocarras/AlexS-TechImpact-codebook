# TechImpact's Data Fellows Python Codebook

#### By [Alex Socarras](https://alexsocarras.com)

This repository contains some of my helper functions and scripts for my day-to-day work as a Data Engineering Fellow at TechImpact. They may represent my contributions to a future standardized Python "codebook" for the whole Data Team.

My specific plans at the moment are to:

* Create some functions for commonplace workflows using Census data, extending the census and pygris packages.
* Write a script for formatting street addresses into the preferred format of our [Geocoder](https://github.com/de-data-lab/Geocoding-Package). 
* Write a set of classes for automating data documentation/data dictionaries and uploading them to the cloud.

The immediate goal of this repo is just to house scripts I can copy over whenever I'm starting an assignment where they're relevant. 

In the future some of this I might make into a package(s).
